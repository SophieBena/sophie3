Equilibrate Examples (Jupyter notebooks)
***************************************************

The **Notebooks/Equilibrate** folder contains Jupyter notebooks that illustrate features 
and capabilities of the Equilibrate class, which is defined in the Equilibrate module. 
The Equilibrate class computes equilibrium phase assemblages given a collection of phases, a bulk composition, and specified values of two thermodynamic variables, e.g., (T,P), (S,P), (T,V) or (S,V).  The class can also compute equilibrium in systems open to mass transfer under conditions of specified chemical potential constraints, e.g., fixed oxygen fugacity, fixed saturation state or fluid or mineral phases.
