Deprecated Examples (Jupyter notebooks)
***************************************

The **Notebooks/Deprecated** folder contains Jupyter notebooks that illustrate features of the ENKI library or calculational methods that are deprecated.  

**The links below access static versions only.** You can access executable versions from the Notebooks folder in the repository.  

- :doc:`Quartz-Berman-oldstyle<Quartz-Berman-oldstyle>`

  Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of quartz using the Berman (1988) database and direct access methods to the underlying code framework. Use of the old-style direct access methods is discouraged in favor of the Python wrapper methods illustrated in the other notebooks.  

- :doc:`Quartz-Holland-Powell-oldstyle<Quartz-Holland-Powell-oldstyle>`

  Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of quartz using the Holland and Powell (2000) database and direct access methods to the underlying code framework. Use of the old-style direct access methods is discouraged in favor of the Python wrapper methods illustrated in the other notebooks.

- :doc:`DEW-Muscovite and DEW-muscovite-fast<DEW-Muscovite and DEW-muscovite-fast>`

  Demonstrate solubility calculations involving muscovite and Cl-rich fluids at elevated pressure and temperature. The file **SverjenskyEtAl1991-Fig1a.png** is required for their execution.
