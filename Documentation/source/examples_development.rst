Development Examples (Jupyter notebooks)
****************************************

The **Notebooks/Development** folder contains notebooks that illustrate new features and capabilities of ENKI software infrastructure.

Equilibrium calculators
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Equilibrate-extension-pure-phases

- Equilibrate-extension-solutions

- Equilibrate-extension-oxygen-water

Support a paper in progress that develops theory for calculating phase equilibria in systems subject to various constraints; e.g., given that the following minerals coexist with a silicate liquid at some T, P condition, at equilibrium, what is the composition of the liquid?
 
The manuscript is located in the folder **ms-Generalized-Equilibrium**.

MELTS-DEW integration
+++++++++++++++++++++

- MELTS-DEW 

Is a prototype for calculations involving the coupled MELTS and DEW solution models.


Thermodynamic Database Calibration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The remaining notebooks in the Development folder deal with Bayesian methods for calibration of pure-component thermodynamic databases. These methods and code are under active development. Data files in the folder **phase-reversal-data** are required for execution of these notebooks.
