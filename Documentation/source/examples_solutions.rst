**The links below access static versions only.** You can access executable versions from the Notebooks folder.        

❇️ :doc:`Clinopyroxene - Number of endmember species equivalent to number of endmember components<Clinopyroxene-MELTS>`

Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of clinopyroxene solid solutions (as utilized in MELTS) utilizing ThermoEngine Python wrappers.  
 
❇️ :doc:`Feldspar Solid Solution - Berman Compatible<Feldspar-ss-Berman>`

Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of feldspar solid solutions (as utilized in MELTS) utilizing ThermoEngine Python wrappers.

❇️ :doc:`Fe-Ti oxide geothermobarometer<Oxide-Geothermometer>` 

Uses opx and cpx solution models from Sack and Ghiorso (1994a,b,c). 

❇️ :doc:`Pyroxene geothermometer<Pyroxene-Geothermometer>` 

Illustrates construction of a two-pyroxene geothermometer using thermodynamic properties from the MELTS package as exposed by ThermoEngine Python wrappers. Calculations rely on Python optimization tools to compute the equilibrium temperature.
