This directory contains subdirectories that provide Jupyter notebooks that illustrate various features of the ENKI software infrastructure.  The directories are:

- [Calibration](#calibration)
- [Codegen](#condegen)
- [Deprecated](#deprecated)
- [Development](#development)
- [DEW](#dew)
- [Equilibrate](#equilibrate)
- [Graphics](#graphics)
- [MELTS-pMELTS](#melts)
- [Pure-Phases](#pure)
- [Solutions](#solution)
- [Utilities](#utilities)

### <a name="calibration">Calibration</a>
Notebooks addressing thermodynamic database calibration.

### <a name="condegen">Codegen</a>
Notebooks that demonsrate how a code base for pure phases and for solutions can be automatically generated in "C" using the SymPy Python package.

Cuurrent examples include the Berman/Holland and Powell/Helgeson et al./Stixrude-Lithgow-Bertelloni standard state mineral properties, HKF standard state solution species, asymmetric rregular solutions with ternary terms (feldspars) and more complex reciprocal solutions with cation ordering (quadrilateral pyroxenes).

### <a name="deprecated">Deprecated</a>
Notebooks whose functionality has been deprecated.

### <a name="development">Development</a>
Notebooks in development.

### <a name="dew">DEW</a>
Notebooks that implement the Deep Earth Water model with some example applications.

### <a name="equilibrate">Equilibrate</a>
Notebooks that demonstrate the use of the Equilibrate class for 
calculation of equilibrium phase relations under a variety of 
external constraints. 

### <a name="graphics">Graphics</a>
Notebooks that illustrate methods and capabilities of the Graphics module, which is designed to produce commonly used plots and graphs of thermodynamic properties, phase diagrams, pseudosections, and solution properties. Under development (see wiki). 

### <a name="melts">MELTS-pMELTS</a>
Notebooks that implement and execute the MELTS and pMELTS models.

### <a name="pure">Pure-Phases</a>
Notebooks that demonstrate computing thermodynamic properties of pure component phases.  Examples from the Berman, Holland and Powel, and Stixrude-Lithgow Bertelloni databases.  

In addition, notebooks for calculating phase diagrams, pseudosections, and for comparing properties between databases.

### <a name="solution">Solutions</a>
Notebooks that demonstrate computing thermodynamic properties of non-aqueous solutions.  Examples from MELTS.  

In addition, notebooks for calculating geothermometers using solution phases.

### <a name="utilities">Utilities</a>
Notebooks that perfoprm various utility functions.
