# Non-aqueous solutions

Jupyter notebooks illustrating calculation of the thermodynamic properties of non-aqueous solutions.

- **Clinopyroxene-MELTS**  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of clinopyroxene solid solutions (as utilized in MELTS) utilizing ThermoEngine Python wrappers.  

- **Feldspar-ss-Berman** (new-style Phases package coding)  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of feldspar solid solutions (as utilized in MELTS) utilizing ThermoEngine Python wrappers.  

- **Oxide-Geothermometer**  
Uses opx and cpx solution models from Sack and Ghiorso (1994a,b,c).   

- **Pyroxene-Geothermometer**  
Illustrates construction of a two-pyroxene geothermometer using thermodynamic properties from teh MELTS package as exposed by ThermoEngine Python wrappers. Calculations rely on Python optimization tools to compute the equilibrium temperature.
