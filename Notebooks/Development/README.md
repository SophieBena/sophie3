# Development notebooks
Jupyter notebooks in development that illustrate new features and capabilities of ENKI software infrastructure.

### Equilibrium calculators
The three notebooks

- **Equilibrate-extension-pure-phases**
- **Equilibrate-extension-solutions**
- **Equilibrate-extension-oxygen-water**

support a paper in progress that develops theory for calculating phase equilibria in systems subject to various constraints, e.g. given that the following minerals coexist with a silicate liquid at some T, P condition, at equilibrium, what is teh composition of the liquid?

The manuscript in progress accompanying these notebooks maybe found in the direcrtory ***ms-Generalized-Equilibrium***. 

### MELTS-DEW integration
The notebooks **MELTS-DEW** and **MELTS-DEW-equilibrium** are prototypes for calculations involving the coupled MELTS and DEW solution models.

### Thermodynamic Database Calibration
The remaining notebooks deal with Bayesian methods for calibration of pure-component thermodynamic databases.  These methods and code are undeer active development.  Data files in teh directory ***phase-reversal-data*** are required for execution of these notebooks.
