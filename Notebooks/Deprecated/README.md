# Deprecated notebooks
These Jupyter notebooks illustrate features of the ENKI library or calculational methods that are deprecated. 

- **Quartz-Berman-oldstyle**  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of quartz using the Berman (1988) database and direct access methods to the underlying code framework.  Use of the old-style direct access methods is discouraged in favor of the Python wrapper methods illustrated in the other notebooks.  

- **Quartz-Holland-Powell-oldstyle**  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of quartz using the Holland and Powell (2000) database and direct access methods to the underlying code framework. Use of the old-style direct access methods is discouraged in favor of the Python wrapper methods illustrated in the other notebooks.

- **DEW-Muscovite** and **DEW-muscovite-fast**  
Demonstrate solubility calculations involving muscovite and Cl-rich fluids at elevated pressure and temperature. The file ***SverjenskyEtAl1991-Fig1a.png*** is required for their execution.

- **MELTSv102**  
Notebook to perform MELTS calculations using direct calls to underlying Objective-C code.  Has been superseeded by Python wrappers available in the Equilibrate package.
