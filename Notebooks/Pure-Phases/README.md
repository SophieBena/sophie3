# Pure phases
Jupyter notebooks that illustrate calculation of thermodynamic properties of pure component phases using established thermodynamic databases.

- **Quartz-Berman**  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of quartz using the Berman (1988) database and the Python ThermoEngine package.

- **Forsterite-Stixrude**  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of forsterite using the Stixrude-Lithgow-Bertelloni (2012) database and the Python ThermoEngine package.

- **Phase-Diagram**  
Illustrates construction of the alumino-silicate phase diagram using the Berman (1988) database and the Python ThermoEngine package.

- **Compare-Phases**  
Illustrates how to compare thermodynamic properties of quartz calculated from three different databases: Berman (1988), Holland and Powell (2000) and Stixrude-Lithgow-Bertelloni (2012), using the Python ThermoEngine package. This notebook requires the file ***Ghiorso-cp-quartz.txt***. 

- **Plot-Reaction**  
Illustrates how to calculate and plot a univariant curve for the reaction forsterite + quartz -> enstatite using the Berman (1988) database and the Python ThermoEngine package.

- **Plot-Reaction-Stixrude**  
Illustrates how to calculate and plot a univariant curve for the reaction forsterite -> magnesio-wadsleyite using the Stixrude-Lithgow-Bertelloni (2012) database and the Python ThermoEngine package.

- **Water**  
Illustrates calculation of the thermodynamic properties of water using the Simulated Water Interpolated Model (SWIM) and direct access methods to the underlying code framework.
