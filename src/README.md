# Objective-C sources
This folder contains source code for Objective-C classes and headers that support the ThermoEngine package.

Additionally, the folder contains a sub-folder of sources that implement the SWIM (Standard Water Integrated Model) thermodynamic model of water.

The Objective-C code in this folder is a legacy implementation that will eventually be replaced by C code automatically generated by the coder python module (see the thermoengine Python package)
